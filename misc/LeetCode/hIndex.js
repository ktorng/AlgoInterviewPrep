/*
Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

/**
 * @param {number[]} citations
 * @return {number}
 */
var hIndex = function(citations) {
  if (citations.length === 0) return null;
  // sort array
  // O(nlog(n))
  const sorted = citations.sort((a, b) => (a-b))
  let max = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < sorted.length; i++) {
    const h = Math.min(sorted.length-i, sorted[i]);
    max = Math.max(h, max);
  }

  return max;
};
